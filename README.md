# Neo4j Movie Graph QA System

This project implements a question-answering system for a movie database using Neo4j graph database and LangChain with the Groq LLM.

## Project Description

This system loads movie data into a Neo4j graph database and uses LangChain with the Groq LLM to answer natural language questions about the movie dataset. It demonstrates the power of combining graph databases with large language models for information retrieval and question answering.
